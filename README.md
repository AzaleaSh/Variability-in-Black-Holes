This is the code for my project at Northwestern University, the goal is to find
variability in black hole accretion disks via mass accretion rate, average radial
velocity, average phi velocity, and average theta velocity.

The scripts folder has all the functions I've used. You can see them in action
in the .ipynb files. This is still a work in progress.
